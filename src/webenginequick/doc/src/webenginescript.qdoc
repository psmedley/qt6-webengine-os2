    \qmltype WebEngineScript
    \instantiates QWebEngineScript
    \brief Enables the programmatic injection of scripts in the JavaScript engine.
    \since QtWebEngine 1.1
    \ingroup qmlvaluetypes
    \inqmlmodule QtWebEngine

    The WebEngineScript type enables the programmatic injection of so called \e {user scripts} in
    the JavaScript engine at different points, determined by injectionPoint, during the loading of
    web content.

    Scripts can be executed either in the main JavaScript \e world, along with the rest of the
    JavaScript coming from the web contents, or in their own isolated world. While the DOM of the
    page can be accessed from any world, JavaScript variables of a function defined in one world are
    not accessible from a different one. The worldId property provides some predefined IDs for this
    purpose.

    The following \l Greasemonkey  attributes are supported:
    \c @exclude, \c @include, \c @name, \c @match, and \c @run-at.

    Use \l{WebEngineScriptCollection} to access a list of scripts attached to the web view.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string WebEngineScript::name

    The name of the script. Can be useful to retrieve a particular script from
    \l{WebEngineScriptCollection::find}{WebEngineScriptCollection.find} method.
*/

*!
    \qmlproperty url WebEngineScript::sourceUrl

    This property holds the remote source location of the user script (if any).

    Unlike \l sourceCode, this property allows referring to user scripts that
    are not already loaded in memory, for instance, when stored on disk.

    Setting this property will change the \l sourceCode of the script.

    \note At present, only file-based sources are supported.

    \sa sourceCode
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string WebEngineScript::sourceCode

    This property holds the JavaScript source code of the user script.

    \sa sourceUrl
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration WebEngineScript::injectionPoint

    The point in the loading process at which the script will be executed.
    The default value is \c Deferred.

    \value WebEngineScript.DocumentCreation
           The script will be executed as soon as the document is created. This is not suitable for
           any DOM operation.
    \value WebEngineScript.DocumentReady
           The script will run as soon as the DOM is ready. This is equivalent to the
           \c DOMContentLoaded event firing in JavaScript.
    \value WebEngineScript.Deferred
           The script will run when the page load finishes, or 500 ms after the document is ready,
           whichever comes first.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty enumeration WebEngineScript::worldId

    The world ID defining which isolated world the script is executed in.

    \value WebEngineScript.MainWorld
           The world used by the page's web contents. It can be useful in order to expose custom
           functionality to web contents in certain scenarios.
    \value WebEngineScript.ApplicationWorld
           The default isolated world used for application level functionality implemented in
           JavaScript.
    \value WebEngineScript.UserWorld
           The first isolated world to be used by scripts set by users if the application is not
           making use of more worlds. As a rule of thumb, if that functionality is exposed to the
           application users, each individual script should probably get its own isolated world.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int WebEngineScript::runOnSubframes

    Set this property to \c true if the script is executed on every frame in the page, or \c false
    if it is only ran for the main frame.
    The default value is \c{false}.
